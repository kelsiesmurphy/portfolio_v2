## Overview

**Project Type:** Personal Project  
**Role:** Owner

GreenCheck is a browser extension that identifies websites powered by green energy, and offers detailed analysis on the siteâ€™s carbon emissions. It supports Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers.

## Details

- This project was designed and built by me after doing a talk at GlasgowJS, and highlighting some useful APIs and tools for tracking website carbon emissions. I had looked for a browser extension that tell you the carbon emission data from a website, but didn't find anything useful, so I decided to build my own.
- This was my first Browser extension, and a departure from the type of projects I am used to.
- Keeping with the theme, I decided to make it's marketing website in a brand new front-end tech stack as well, Sveltekit.
- I found a useful framework for building browser extensions called Plasmo, which helped to the learning process as it was similar in style to NextJS.
- It uses APIs such as the [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/) to get the data necessary for the carbon calculations, and the green web check itself.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Plasmo, SvelteKit
- **Database:** Supabase
- **Other Tools:** Git, Cloudflare, Google Dev Dashboard, Firefox Dev Dashboard, Edge Dev Dashboard.

## Challenges

- **Limited Documentation:** Developing the extension using the framework had it's benefits, but it has a very small community, limited documentation, and I had to do quite a lot of debugging at various stages to get it working smoothly. 
- **Multiple Browsers:** Developing for multiple browsers has it's own separate issues, and I think I would like to expand the browsers out to additional ones in future, but this will come with further challenges.
