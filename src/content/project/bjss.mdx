## Overview

**Project Type:** Employment  
**Duration:** June 2023 - present  
**Role:** Software Engineer  

BJSS is an IT consultancy that delivers digital transformation through software engineering, strategy, and technology solutions for its clients around the world, which include NHS Digital, Specsavers, DVSA and much more.

I joined via the BJSS Academy, where I received additional training within the first 12 months of my role at BJSS, getting hands on experience in a number of technologies in cloud computing, software engineering, platform, testing, Agility, architecture, UI, API, databases and more.

## Projects

- A proof of concept for a major bank for 12 weeks, exploring the use cases for Google Apigee X, an API Management solution. I worked in a small team, integrated with the banks own developer team to complete this POC.
- A mobile application for a charity in Scotland that helped users with disabilities locate public toilets around Glasgow. We built the mobile application using React Native, and the charity has launched it in beta. I was heavily involved in building the initial version of the application based on the client's brief, and showcased our progress back to the client periodically. We built this in collaboration with [Scottish Tech Army](https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/).
- A proof of concept for users to self-exclude from gambling in their country, I built out the front-end of the application using React, TailwindCSS and connected it to the backend for the POC.
- I am currently on a long-term client in the energy sector within their web development team, splitting my time between front-end development on their website using NextJS and React, and building complex email campaigns using an internal framework.
