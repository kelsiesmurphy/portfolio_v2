## Overview

**Project Type:** Personal Project  
**Role:** Owner 

CommunitySpot is a community management tool built for small community groups. Community organisers can set up their community page and manage upcoming events, photos and memberships, and community members can join and stay updated with group activities easily.

## Details

- I attend various networking events and social meetups, and it can be hard to connect with other like minded people after an event. This is usually done by using a social media tool such as LinkedIn or Whatsapp, but this moves away from the community dynamic, and I think it would be useful to have this all in one place.
- As well as the above, for small communities having a website can be costly and take up a lot of time to manage, so having a CommunitySpot page could replace the need for a separate community website.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend:** NextJS, HTML, CSS, ShadcnUI, TailwindCSS, RadixUI, GSAP, Framer Motion
- **Database:** Supabase, PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools:** Resend, Netlify, Stripe
