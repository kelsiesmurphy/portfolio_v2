## Overview

**Project Type:** Personal Project  
**Role:** Owner

PlanetCareer is an job application tracker that makes keeping track of job applications easier, and an enjoyable experience. Users add their job to their board via the simple interface, and can easily update the stage of their application with a click. To see a demo of it, visit [PlanetCareer's Demo page](https://www.planetcareer.co.uk/dashboard-demo). This project has been running publicly since April 2023, and has gained 60+ of real world users via word of mouth.

## Design

This was designed by myself using Figma and UntitledUI. I used Dribbble for inspiration, and Google Fonts to choose a suitable font for the project.

## Reflections

I built this app to fix a problem for myself whilst looking for junior developer roles, and wanting to work for companies that are ethical and purpose-driven. I was also tracking my job applications using Notion, and decided I could build a custom solution, and other people might want to use it too.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend:** NextJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS, HeadlessUI
- **Database:** Supabase
- **Other Tools:** Git, Plunk, Notion, Typeform, Vercel

## Challenges

- **Company Logos:** A feature I wanted was when you add a job to the board, it finds the company logo from an API and shows it seamlessly. A challenge I faced with this was finding a suitable API, and integrating it smoothly into the tool. These was surprisingly more difficult than expected, but once I found an API that worked well, I was happy with the result.
- **Getting User Feedback:** I ended up building a form using Typeform and integrated it into the application, and got several pieces of useful feedback I was able to fix!

## Outcome and Impact

- I have active users, with 200+ applications logged in the tool this year, all gained via word of mouth.
- I have had emails from people saying it's benefitted their job searching process.
- I gained valuable knowledge in the decisions for future projects, from the tech stack to the high-level understanding of an end-to-end product launch.
