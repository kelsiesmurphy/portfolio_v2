### Project Overview

Before diving into the code, let me give you an overview of what I wanted to achieve. My goal was to create a portfolio that could show off my work in a creative and engaging way. I also wanted to have a blog section to share my thoughts on various web technologies. 

I decided to use the following stack:
- **Astro** for static site generation.
- **ThreeJS** for interactive 3D content.
- **GSAP** for smooth, powerful animations.
- **Framer Motion** for page transitions and micro-interactions.
- **Markdown** for easy blog content creation.

### Why I Chose These Technologies

#### Astro
Astro's unique "Island Architecture" allows for fast, SEO-friendly static site generation. I wanted a fast website that didn’t require a heavy front-end framework on every page, so Astro was the perfect fit.

#### ThreeJS
Since I wanted some 3D elements on the homepage, I chose ThreeJS, which is known for rendering 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It’s powerful and easy to integrate with modern front-end frameworks.

#### GSAP
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) offers unparalleled control over animations. It allowed me to easily create smooth animations that perform well, even with complex 3D objects.

#### Framer Motion
For smooth page transitions and micro-interactions, Framer Motion is fantastic. Its React-friendly API made it a great choice for transitions between Astro pages and for animating UI elements.

### Setting Up Astro for Static Site Generation

I began the project by setting up Astro, which I found to be incredibly intuitive. Here's a basic breakdown of the setup process:

1. **Installing Astro**:
    ```bash
    npm init astro
    ```

2. **Configuring Astro**: Astro makes it easy to customize the site with minimal configuration. I created a basic layout for the site, utilizing partial hydration for components that needed interactivity.

3. **Folder Structure**:
    Astro encourages a clean folder structure. Here’s how I organized mine:
    ```
    /src
      /components
      /layouts
      /pages
      /public
    ```

4. **Using Astro Components**: Astro supports lightweight components from various front-end frameworks. For my project, I kept some components static and added interactivity only when necessary, to maintain performance.

### Adding 3D Elements with ThreeJS

One of the key features of my website is the interactive 3D elements on the homepage. Here’s how I integrated ThreeJS with Astro:

1. **Installing ThreeJS**:
    ```bash
    npm install three
    ```

2. **Setting Up a Basic Scene**:
    I started by creating a simple ThreeJS scene with a rotating cube. Here’s the basic code I used to set up the scene:
    ```js
    import * as THREE from 'three';

    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
    const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.add(cube);

    camera.position.z = 5;

    const animate = function () {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
      cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
      cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };

    animate();
    ```

3. **Integrating with Astro**: To avoid any performance issues, I only loaded the ThreeJS scene on the pages where it was needed using Astro’s built-in component loading methods.

### Animating with GSAP

After setting up the 3D elements, I wanted to animate them using GSAP. Here’s how I did it:

1. **Installing GSAP**:
    ```bash
    npm install gsap
    ```

2. **Basic GSAP Animations**:
    GSAP makes it easy to add complex animations. Here’s an example of how I animated the cube’s rotation:
    ```js
    import { gsap } from 'gsap';

    gsap.to(cube.rotation, { x: 2 * Math.PI, duration: 2, repeat: -1 });
    ```

3. **Scroll Animations**: I also used GSAP’s scroll trigger to animate elements as they came into view on scroll.

### Smoothing Transitions with Framer Motion

Framer Motion allowed me to add smooth transitions between different pages. Here’s how I set it up:

1. **Installing Framer Motion**:
    ```bash
    npm install framer-motion
    ```

2. **Page Transitions**:
    I created a wrapper component that handled page transitions using Framer Motion’s `AnimatePresence` component:
    ```jsx
    import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion';

    const PageTransition = ({ children }) => (
      <AnimatePresence>
        <motion.div
          initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
          exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
        >
          {children}
        </motion.div>
      </AnimatePresence>
    );

    export default PageTransition;
    ```

3. **Using Framer Motion for Micro-Interactions**: Framer Motion also came in handy for animating buttons and other small elements to enhance the user experience.

### Setting Up a Markdown Blog

For the blog section, I wanted a simple setup where I could write posts in Markdown. Astro makes this incredibly easy:

1. **Creating Markdown Files**: Each blog post is a Markdown file located in the `/src/pages/blog` folder. Here’s an example post structure:
    ```
    /blog
      /my-first-post.md
    ```

2. **Frontmatter**: Each Markdown file contains frontmatter to define the metadata (title, date, etc.):
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "My First Blog Post"
    date: "2024-10-10"
    description: "This is the first post on my blog."
    ---
    ```

3. **Rendering Markdown in Astro**: Astro automatically converts Markdown files into pages, making it easy to maintain the blog without any additional setup.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

Building the website came with a few challenges:
- **Performance Optimizations**: Initially, loading heavy 3D elements on every page slowed down the site. I solved this by lazy loading the 3D content and optimizing the ThreeJS scenes.
- **GSAP vs. Framer Motion**: Deciding when to use GSAP vs. Framer Motion was tricky. I ended up using GSAP for complex 3D animations and Framer Motion for UI interactions and transitions.
- **Markdown Blog Setup**: Astro’s markdown setup is straightforward, but I did spend some time customizing the styling and layout for the blog.

### Conclusion

Overall, building my personal website with Astro, ThreeJS, GSAP, and Framer Motion was a great experience. These technologies allowed me to create a fast, interactive, and visually engaging site. If you're interested in building something similar, I highly recommend experimenting with this stack!
