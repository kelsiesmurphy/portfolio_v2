import EarthCanvas from "@/components/react/Projects/Earth";

Today I'm going to write about how I built my personal website (this website!) using a combination of [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/). I’ll also touch on I integrated this blog, written in markdown. If you're looking for any ideas to integrate into your own personal website, there might be something in here that may help you!

### Project Overview

Before diving into the code, let me give you an overview of what I wanted to achieve. My goal was to create a portfolio that could show off my work in a creative and fun way. I also wanted to have a blog section to share my thoughts on various web technologies (good for SEO too eh?).

I decided to use the following stack:
- **Astro** for static site generation.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling.
- **ThreeJS** for the earth component on the homepage.
- **GSAP** and **Framer Motion** for smooth, funky animations.
- **Markdown** for easy blog content creation.

### Why I Chose These Technologies

#### Astro
Astro's is fast, SEO friendly and really easy to set up. I was inspired by [Jamie McHale](https://www.jamiemchale.com/), who runs my [local Javascript meetup group](https://www.glasgowjs.com/), to try out Astro, and love that I can drop in my own React and Svelte components directly into the code. I think it was an ideal pick for this website. To style the website, I used TailwindCSS, as I enjoy using it and can build out frontend elements quite quickly with it.

#### ThreeJS
I really wanted to have some cool interactive elements on the homepage, and had recently completed the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) course, and was inspired to add an element of the Earth which would spin around. Later I decided to add this as a backdrop to my projects section, which would spin in a subtle way as the user scrolls down the page.

#### GSAP and Framer Motion
I am not yet an expert on either of these technologies, but I hope to use them in projects in the future, and drew inspiration from [Olivier Larose's blog](https://blog.olivierlarose.com/) for elements on the site.

#### Markdown
I enjoy using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking, and i'm already used to writing in markdown, so this seemed like a good way to write my blog posts. I took advantage of Astro, MDX for markdown and the Typography plugin for TailwindCSS to create a blog post system that lets me add React or Svelte components directly into the blog posts, as you'll see later in this blog.

### Setting Up Astro for Static Site Generation

I began the project by setting up Astro, which if you want, you can do [from scratch](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), or use a [pre-built theme as a template](https://astro.build/themes/). I was actually using Deno v2 to set up my website, as it had just been announced and I was curious to try it, but that might be a blog post for another day. This meant I skipped installing a linter, or Prettier, as these came built in with Deno v2. I also installed TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI at this stage.

1. **Installing Astro from scratch**:
    ```bash
    npm create astro@latest
    ```

3. **Folder Structure**:
    Astro encourages a clean folder structure. Here’s how I organised mine:
    ```
    /public
    /src
      /components
        /react
        /ui
      /content
        /blog
        /project
      /layouts
      /lib
      /pages
        /blog
        /projects
      /styles
    ```

### Adding 3D Elements with ThreeJS

The part of the website I probably spent the most time on was the earth element that rotates when you scroll past it.

{/* <section class="bg-[#24292e] h-96 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
  <EarthCanvas client:only />
</section> */}

### Smoothing Transitions with Framer Motion

Framer Motion allowed me to add smooth transitions between different pages. Here’s how I set it up:

1. **Installing Framer Motion**:
    ```bash
    npm install framer-motion
    ```

2. **Page Transitions**:
    I created a wrapper component that handled page transitions using Framer Motion’s `AnimatePresence` component:


3. **Using Framer Motion for Micro-Interactions**: Framer Motion also came in handy for animating buttons and other small elements to enhance the user experience.

### Setting Up a Markdown Blog

For the blog section, I wanted a simple setup where I could write posts in Markdown. Astro makes this incredibly easy:

1. **Creating Markdown Files**: Each blog post is a Markdown file located in the `/src/pages/blog` folder. Here’s an example post structure:
    ```
    /blog
      /my-first-post.md
    ```

2. **Frontmatter**: Each Markdown file contains frontmatter to define the metadata (title, date, etc.):
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "My First Blog Post"
    date: "2024-10-10"
    description: "This is the first blog."
    ---
    ```

3. **Rendering Markdown in Astro**: Astro automatically converts Markdown files into pages, making it easy to maintain the blog without any additional setup.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

Building the website came with a few challenges:
- **Performance Optimizations**: Initially, loading heavy 3D elements on every page slowed down the site. I solved this by lazy loading the 3D content and optimizing the ThreeJS scenes.
- **GSAP vs. Framer Motion**: Deciding when to use GSAP vs. Framer Motion was tricky. I ended up using GSAP for complex 3D animations and Framer Motion for UI interactions and transitions.
- **Markdown Blog Setup**: Astro’s markdown setup is straightforward, but I did spend some time customizing the styling and layout for the blog.

### Conclusion

Overall, building my personal website with Astro, ThreeJS, GSAP, and Framer Motion was a great experience. These technologies allowed me to create a fast, interactive, and visually engaging site. If you're interested in building something similar, I highly recommend experimenting with this stack!
